# NYC Squirrel Census Analysis 

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data. It offers valuable insights and visualizations about squirrel sightings in New York City's Central Park, utilizing advanced data processing and geospatial visualization techniques. It provides an interactive data visualization of the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Folium, the project visualizes squirrel sightings, behaviors, and fur colors on an interactive map of NYC’s Central Park.

The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public. This table contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.
